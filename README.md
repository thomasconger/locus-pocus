### General Developement Workflow

I tried two different development workflows while making this project. In the first, which was far less productive, I tried to finish a single file before moving on to the next based on the idea that I should finish a feature before moving on, but I had a hard time judging completion and testing.  In the second, which was far more productive, I focused on pushing a single user path forward at a time, making contributions across files in the order they were needed in order to process a request. 

In both workflows, I tried to push single features forward at a time, which I think was the right choice, but because I wasn't comfortable enough to finish an entire file at once, I struggled to constructively iterate. You live and you learn! Once I made the adjustment to how I worked during this project, the amount of progress I was able to make day by day increased exponentially.
